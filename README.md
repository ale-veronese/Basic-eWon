# Basic-eWon

This code was created by me to be used within the eWon IDE, and it won't run outside of the eWon environment.
It was part of the the final project of the Mechatronics and Robotics program at BCIT.
This is a backup of the final code.
eWon Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language.
